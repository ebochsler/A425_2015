When the sum of the angular diameter distance to galaxy 1 and that from galaxy 1 to galaxy 2 are compared to the angular diameter distance to galaxy 2, the two diameter distances are not equal. This is because angular diameter distance does not increase linearly, so the two cannot simply be summed to determine angular diameter distance to galaxy 2."

The mean free path is given by $d = {1 \\over\\Sigma \\rho}$ where $\\Sigma$ represents the cross section of a typical galaxy and $\\rho$ is the number density of galaxies. To find the average time before a galaxy collide I divided the mean free path by the velocity dispersion of the Coma Cluster. I found the average time it takes for galaxies to collide in the Coma Cluster to be 15.7 Gyr, which is larger than the Hubble time of 13.8 Gyr."
